Custom protocol for Opentrons OT-2 liquid handling robot

With user-specified input column numbers for the forward and reverse index primer plates, this script enables
index primer addition to a single 96-well PCR plate from forward and reverse index primer plates. 
This increases possible index combinations from 96 to 13824 and enables simultaneous sequencing of 144 96-well plates

With special tuning of the robot head speed, air gapping, and path optimization, this protocol minimizes sample runtime and chances for contamination
while efficiently distributing volumes as low as 1 microliter.
